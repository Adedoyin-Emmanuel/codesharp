# CodeSharp üéñÔ∏è

Code Sharp is a [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) extension tailored for .NET developers, designed to simplify the creation of C# files through customizable templates. Whether you‚Äôre working with classes, interfaces, or other file types, CodeSharp automates repetitive tasks, allowing you to focus on writing great code. Codesharp also adds automatically adds your project namespace to the file generated.

## Features üîß

1. **Template-based file generation**: Generate C# files like classes, interfaces, or custom types using pre-defined or user-configured templates.
2. **Namespace handling**: Automatically derive the correct namespace based on your project structure.
3. **Intelligent file placement**: Files are generated in the currently active folder, with a fallback to the project‚Äôs root directory if no specific folder is selected.
4. **Smart C# File Detection**: Intelligently activates and provides C# file templates only when you're working on a C# or .NET project. This ensures

- **Automatic Detection**: The extension will detect if you're working within a C#-related environment (i.e., when .cs, .csproj, .sln, or other related files are present).

- **Selective Loading**: If you're working outside of a C# or .NET project, CodeSharp stays idle, ensuring that it doesn't clutter your workspace or consume unnecessary resources.

This behavior makes CodeSharp lightweight and highly optimized for C# developers, while staying out of the way for non-C# projects.
